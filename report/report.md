# **Deepfake Detector**

## **Abstract**
The rapid advancement of deep learning techniques has led to the creation of hyper-realistic synthetic media, known as deepfakes. While these have potential for legitimate uses, they also pose serious ethical and security risks. This project focuses on developing a robust deepfake detection system using advanced machine learning algorithms to identify manipulated media with high accuracy.

## **Introduction**
Deepfake technology has introduced significant challenges in distinguishing real media from fabricated ones. Generated using techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), deepfakes can manipulate images and videos to appear authentic. 

### **Project Objectives**
- Develop a machine learning model capable of identifying deepfakes in video and image data.
- Achieve high accuracy and low false-positive rates for reliable detection.
- Provide a scalable solution deployable on web or mobile platforms for real-time detection.

## **Methodology**

### **Dataset Preparation**
- **Sources**:
  - Real and fake datasets were sourced from publicly available repositories like the [DeepFake Detection Challenge Dataset (DFDC)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/data) and Celeb-DF.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Frames were extracted from videos at regular intervals.
  - Images were normalized and resized to ensure consistent input dimensions for the model.

### **Model Architecture**
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture was used, fine-tuned on pre-trained models such as EfficientNet or ResNet.
  - The model focused on detecting subtle inconsistencies like facial textures, lighting mismatches, and boundary artifacts.
- **Classification**:
  - A binary classification layer was implemented to distinguish between real and fake inputs.

### **Training and Validation**
- **Data Split**: The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% validation sets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and noise addition were applied to improve model generalization.
- **Optimizer and Loss Function**: The Adam optimizer with binary cross-entropy loss was employed for training.

### **Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
